# Job-Search-Recommender-System

This code helps job seekers find relevant data science related jobs based on a search query.

It is an extension of my previous webscraping assignment using LinkedIn and Glassdoor job postings, where I extracted two datasets with information on available jobs, such as title, description, and employer. Using this information, it takes a user's search query or personal statement. Using TF-IDF and BM25 scoring methodologies, the model ranks and outputs a table of relevant jobs.
